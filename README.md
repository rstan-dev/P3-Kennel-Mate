Welcome Russ-S,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!

## User Experience

   ### Purpose and target audience

   * Kennel-Mate is a simple admin booking system for a doggy daycare business, safely backed up and updated to a google cloud worksheet.

   ### User Story

   * The user is presented with an attractive intuitive command-line admin portal, navigating through various menu choices.
   *  The user can choose to create a booking, 
   *  The user can choose to update a booking, 
   *  The user can choose to delete a booking 
   *  The user can choose to view bookings in the system.
   *  The user can find bookings by booking number
   * The user can find bookings by booking date, 
   * The user can find bookings by dog’s name.
   * The user will be presented with a list of relevant bookings at various points in the program, which will also include a useful count of the total bookings in the view and a total of the revenue for those bookings.
   *  The user will be notified when the data has been updated after each action

  ### Goals
   * The program should be clear and easy to use by anyone, with very little training required.
   * The information displayed should be relevant to each menu item selected
   * The system should automatically generate a sequential booking number, which can be used as a unique identifier
   * The system should retrieve, add, update or delete the correct information from a Google worksheet via API calls.
   * The user should easily be able to exit a menu or return to the previous menu or main menu.
   * The user should be given clear instructions, within the program, if any entry or selection is invalid.
