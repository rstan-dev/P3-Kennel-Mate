# TESTING
* The following tests were carried out on the code and the system

## PEP-8
* After the code was written, each line of code was checked for problems and errors identified in the Problems panel of Gitpod.
* The Problems panel is a built-in feature of Gitpod that displays any issues or errors detected in the codebase.
* These issues included syntax errors, semantic errors and warnings similar to the below:
