# TESTING
* The following tests were carried out on the code and the system:

## PEP-8
* After the code was written, each line of code was checked for problems and errors identified in the Problems Panel of Gitpod.
* The Problems Panel is a built-in feature of Gitpod that displays any issues or errors detected in the codebase.
* These issues included syntax errors, semantic errors and warnings similar to the below:

* All but 9 small issues were resolved. The remaining were considered inconsequential to the project, and noted, but left as small bugs unresolved.

* Once this was completed, the code was passed through a [PEP8 Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and passed.

## HTML Validation
* A small amount of HTML was used for the landing page, so validation was carried out on this code.

## CSS Validation
* A small amount of CSS was used for the landing page, so validation was carried out on this code.

* There were several warnings unrelated to the code base, so these were noted but left as is

## Lighthouse Report
* This project was focused on the Terminal application and system design in Python, and less about website performance, however, a healthy Lighthouse report was generated

## USER STORY TESTS
* The system was tested extensively and systematically as a user, entering information in the correct format and in various incorrect formats.
* The tests were designed around the original User Story and Goals set out at the start of the project:
 * The user is presented with an attractive intuitive command-line admin portal, navigating through various menu choices.
 * The user can choose to create a booking.
 * The user can choose to update a booking.
 * The user can choose to delete a booking.
 * The user can choose to view bookings in the system.
 * The user can find bookings by booking number.
 * The user can find bookings by booking date.
 * The user can find bookings by dogâ€™s name.
 * The user will be presented with a list of relevant bookings at various points in the program, which will also include a useful count of the total bookings, and a total of the revenue for those bookings.
 * The user will be notified when the data has been updated after each action.

* The results were captured and failing tests were rectified until the test passed.

* There was one Failed test (see KOT11 below) which was left (and noted in unresolved bugs) as it did not impede the system's performance.
* The Amount Charged numbers displayed in the table did not always show a number with 2 decimal places. This format of the Revenue Total number was correct with 2 decimal places.
