# TESTING
* The following tests were carried out on the code and the system

## PEP-8
* After the code was written, each line of code was checked for problems and errors identified in the Problems panel of Gitpod.
* The Problems panel is a built-in feature of Gitpod that displays any issues or errors detected in the codebase.
* These issues included syntax errors, semantic errors and warnings similar to the below:

* All but 9 small issues were resolved. The remaining were considered inconseqential to the project, and noted, but left as small bugs unresolved

* Once this was completed, the code was passed through a [PEP8 Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and passed

## Lighthouse Report
* This project was focused on the Terminal application and system design in python, and less about website performance, however a healthy Lighthouse report was generated

## USER STORY TESTS
* The system was tested extensively and systematically as a user, entering information in the correct format and in various incorrect formats.
* The results were captured and failing tests were rectified until the test passed.

* There was one Failed test (see KOT11 below) which was left as it did not impede the systems performance.
* The amount charged in the table did not always show a number with 2 decimal places.
* This was addressed in the format of the Revenue Total number
